Due to its size, the dataset could not be included. We have given however the directory structure as required by our program.

Then, replace the 'FreeSounds' and 'RealSounds' directories with those just downloaded. 

The rest of the directories are there to keep the data in the intermediate steps of data preprocessing. The files can be generated by the scripts found in the Preprocessing directory.
